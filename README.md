# Scoped CSS variables and JavaScript

---


This project is part of the JavaScript30 challenge, a free 30-day coding challenge created by Wes Bos that focuses on building real-world projects using vanilla JavaScript. The specific project in question is titled "Scoped CSS Variables and JavaScript" and is designed to help you improve your skills in working with CSS variables and manipulating them using JavaScript.

The project involves creating a web page with an interface that allows users to adjust the values of CSS variables dynamically, and see the changes reflected in the webpage in real-time. The CSS variables are scoped to specific elements on the page, which means they only affect those particular elements and their child elements, without affecting other elements on the page. The project also involves using JavaScript to update the values of the CSS variables based on user input, and leveraging the power of CSS transitions to create smooth animations.

The technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML is used to create the structure of the web page, while CSS is used to define the styles and layout, including the scoped CSS variables. JavaScript is used to handle user input, dynamically update the values of the CSS variables, and trigger CSS transitions.

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with CSS variables, scoping them to specific elements, and manipulating them using JavaScript. I also learned how to create dynamic web interfaces that respond to user input and create smooth animations using CSS transitions.
